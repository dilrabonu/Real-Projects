# ðŸ“± Average Daily Screen Time for Children â€“ ML Analysis

Welcome to this machine learning project where we analyze and predict **average daily screen time** in children based on demographic and temporal factors using various models including **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset Description

The dataset contains insights on how children's screen time varies based on:

- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Screen Time Type**: Educational, Recreational, Total
- **Day Type**: Weekday vs Weekend
- **Sample Size** per group

ðŸ—‚ File: `screen_time.csv`  
ðŸ§® Total entries: 108 rows

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

1. **Explore patterns in children's screen time behavior**
2. **Analyze how age, gender, and day type influence screen time**
3. **Predict total average screen time using ML models**
4. **Evaluate model performance using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ²**
5. **Identify most important features influencing screen time**

## ðŸ§ª ML Models Used

- âœ… Linear Regression (Baseline)
- ðŸŒ² Random Forest Regressor
- âš¡ XGBoost Regressor (with hyperparameter tuning)
- ðŸ§ª K-Fold & LOOCV Cross-Validation

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

- **Age** is the most significant predictor of screen time.
- **Gender** had very little impact on overall screen time.
- **Weekend screen time** was slightly higher than weekdays.
- XGBoost performed best on test data (RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.99), but showed instability under K-Fold CV due to small dataset size.
