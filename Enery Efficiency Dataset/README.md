# 📊 Building Energy Efficiency Prediction

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project aims to predict **Heating Load** and **Cooling Load** for buildings based on various structural and design features. The dataset used for this study comes from a **building energy efficiency analysis**, where different parameters influence the energy consumption of a building.

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset consists of multiple features that impact energy efficiency, including:

### **🔹 Features (Input Variables):**
- **Relative Compactness**: The ratio of building volume to the total exterior surface area.
- **Surface Area**: The total exterior surface area of the building.
- **Wall Area**: The total wall area of the building.
- **Roof Area**: The total roof area of the building.
- **Overall Height**: The height of the building.
- **Orientation**: The cardinal orientation of the building (1-4 scale).
- **Glazing Area**: The total window area as a percentage of the building facade.
- **Glazing Area Distribution**: The distribution of glazing on different sides of the building.

### **🔹 Target Variables (Output Variables):**
- **Heating Load (kWh/m²)**: Energy required for heating the building.
- **Cooling Load (kWh/m²)**: Energy required for cooling the building.

## 🚀 Machine Learning Models Used
To build an accurate prediction model, two popular gradient boosting algorithms were implemented:

### **📌 XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)**
- Pros: Handles missing values, efficient computation, and regularization to prevent overfitting.
- Best Performance:
  - **Heating Load:** MAE: **0.29**, RMSE: **0.41**, R²: **1.00** ✅
  - **Cooling Load:** MAE: **0.64**, RMSE: **1.04**, R²: **0.99** ✅

### **📌 LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)**
- Pros: Faster training speed, efficient memory usage, and optimized for large datasets.
- Performance:
  - **Heating Load:** MAE: **0.30**, RMSE: **0.41**, R²: **1.00**
  - **Cooling Load:** MAE: **0.68**, RMSE: **1.06**, R²: **0.99**

## 📊 Feature Importance Analysis
Feature importance was analyzed for both models, and **Relative Compactness** emerged as the most significant factor in predicting both **Heating Load** and **Cooling Load**. Other influential factors include **Glazing Area Distribution, Orientation, and Wall Area**.

## 🔧 Next Steps
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Further fine-tuning of model parameters for improved accuracy.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combining XGBoost and LightGBM using a stacking approach.
- **Feature Engineering**: Exploring polynomial and interaction features to enhance predictive power.

## 🏆 Conclusion
- **XGBoost outperformed LightGBM for both Heating Load and Cooling Load predictions.**
- The dataset provides valuable insights into how building design affects energy efficiency.
- Future improvements include **advanced tuning, ensemble modeling, and real-world deployment.**
