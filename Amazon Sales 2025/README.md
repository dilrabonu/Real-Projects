# ðŸ›’ Amazon Sales 2025 â€“ ML Pipeline & Data Analysis

This project is part of my **Python & Machine Learning 30-Day Marathon** where I build real-world data science workflows from scratch. In this notebook, I worked on a complete **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** using the Amazon Sales 2025 dataset from Kaggle.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

To explore sales data, generate business insights through visualizations, and build a machine learning model that can **classify customers as high spenders** based on their purchasing behavior.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

The dataset contains 250 records and 11 columns, including:
- `Order ID`, `Date`, `Product`, `Category`
- `Price`, `Quantity`, `Total Sales`
- `Customer Name`, `Location`, `Payment Method`, `Status`

## âœ… Key Tasks Performed

- ðŸ“Œ Data Cleaning: checked for nulls & duplicates  
- ðŸ“ˆ Exploratory Data Analysis: visualized trends by product, category, payment, location  
- ðŸ”§ Feature Engineering: created new column `Price Per Unit`, defined `High Spender` target  
- ðŸ”„ Categorical Encoding: converted non-numeric values using `LabelEncoder`  
- ðŸ§  Model Building:
  - Trained Random Forest and Logistic Regression
  - Compared accuracy and classification metrics
- ðŸŽ¯ Final Goal: Accurately predict if a customer is a high spender using selected features

## ðŸš€ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter (Kaggle Notebook)

## ðŸ“Œ Key Learnings

- Choosing the **right target** is more important than using complex models  
- Feature engineering is a powerful way to improve model accuracy  
- Visualization helps guide business decisions before modeling  
- Simple models, when correctly applied, can deliver impressive results
