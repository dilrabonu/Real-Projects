This project focuses on **classifying breast cancer tumors** as **malignant (0)** or **benign (1)** using machine learning. The dataset used in this project contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. The goal is to build a **highly accurate** and **reliable** model to assist in early diagnosis.

## üìä **Key Highlights**
- **Accuracy**: 99%
- **ROC-AUC Score**: 1.00
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: 0.99 for both classes
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Correlation heatmaps, pairplots, boxplots, and ROC curves
- **Feature Engineering**: SMOTE for class imbalance, feature scaling
- **Model**: Logistic Regression (with potential for other models like Random Forest, XGBoost)

## üöÄ **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Exploration**: Analyzed the dataset to understand feature distributions and class imbalance.
2. **Advanced Visualizations**: Created correlation heatmaps, pairplots, and boxplots to gain insights into feature relationships.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Handled class imbalance using **SMOTE** and scaled features using **StandardScaler**.
4. **Model Building**: Built and trained a **Logistic Regression** model, achieving **99% accuracy** and a **ROC-AUC score of 1.00**.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the model using **confusion matrices**, **ROC curves**, and **classification reports**.
6. **Feature Importance**: Analyzed feature importance to identify the most influential features in tumor classification.

## üìà **Results**
The model achieved **near-perfect performance**:
- **Accuracy**: 99%
- **ROC-AUC Score**: 1.00
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: 0.99 for both malignant and benign classes

These results indicate that the model is **highly reliable** for classifying breast cancer tumors.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Advanced data visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model building and evaluation.
- **Imbalanced-learn**: Handling class imbalance using SMOTE.
