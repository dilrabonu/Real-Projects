This give a bigger chance that they will care about the Villain NPC\'s motives and truly despise him for it.\n','RS Conley',https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/93,http://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/584/how-do-i-create-a-great-fantasy-villain-that-inspires-the-party-to-rally-against,CULTURE,rpg.stackexchange.com,0.8888888888888888,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5555555555555556,0.6666666666666666,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.8888888888888888,1.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,1.0,0.8,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.7777777777777778,,,,,,https rpg stackexchange com users,rpg stackexchange com,https rpg stackexchange com users rpg stackexchange com

Rhythm and lead both have a function to serve and sometimes the rhythm is more important, sometime less important. Sometimes you gotta tell the soloist to chillax a few bars and let this groove breathe. The lead is the driver, but the rhythm is the horsepower. \n\nAnd lead playing can be very rhythmic. Listen to some Louis Armstrong trumpet solos where he\'s just wailing the hell out of one note. But all the bending and wiggling is in rhythm. \n','luser droog',https://music.stackexchange.com/users/1344,http://music.stackexchange.com/questions/10584/learning-how-to-be-a-good-rhythm-guitarist-before-becoming-a-lead-guitarist-whe,LIFE_ARTS,music.stackexchange.com,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.4,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,sometime less important sometimes gotta tell soloist chillax bars let groove breathe lead driver,https music stackexchange com users,sometime less important sometimes gotta tell soloist chillax bars let groove breathe lead driver https music stackexchange com users

Spend some time around folks thinking about plasma physics, or wrap your head around the behavior of the sun\'s magnetic field reversal cycle, for a very different perspective.\n',rob,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/44126,http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/128512/why-are-magnetic-fields-so-much-weaker-than-electric,SCIENCE,physics.stackexchange.com,1.0,0.7777777777777778,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.4444444444444444,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.8888888888888888,1.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.8888888888888888,,magnetic interactions occur second order spend time around folks thinking plasma physics,rob,magnetic interactions occur second order spend time around folks thinking plasma physics rob

121, the stolen card is discarded immediately and you gain no benefit from doing so.\n  \n  Example : If a 1-2-3 is docked at the Raiders’ Outpost and the next player rolls a 2-3-4 then that player may remove the 1-2-3 and dock their 2-3-4 at the facility to conduct their own raid. If another player rolls a 3-4-5 or a 4-5-6 then they may remove the 2-3-4 and dock their own sequence and conduct their own raid.\n\n\nThe addition of a second example should clear up this question.\n\n\n  Example 2: RED has docked a 3-4-5 at the Raiders\' Outpost. On his turn GREEN uses the Plasma Cannon to send the 5 back to the Maintenance Bay, leaving a 3 and 4 on the Raiders\' Outpost. To dock a higher-value sequence at the Raiders\' Outpost GREEN must use a run of three ships that totals more than the sum of the ships currently docked there. The remaining ships total 7 so GREEN may not dock a 1-2-3 since they only total 6. GREEN may dock a 2-3-4 (total 9), a 3-4-5 (total 12) or a 4-5-6 (total 15) to use the Raiders\' Outpost.\n\n\nErrata can be found on BoardGameGeek.  \n','Neal Tibrewala',https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/587,http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/1738/in-alien-frontiers-how-does-raiders-outpost-work-after-a-ship-has-been-telepor,CULTURE,boardgames.stackexchange.com,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,0.6666666666666666,1.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.8333333333333334,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,1.0,,,,total total use raiders outpost n n nerrata found boardgamegeek n,http boardgames stackexchange com questions alien frontiers raiders outpost work ship telepor,total total use raiders outpost n n nerrata found boardgamegeek n http boardgames stackexchange com questions alien frontiers raiders outpost work ship telepor
122, leaving only their metallic or compressed matter cores. Depending on the size of the star and the distance between the local stars, nearby star systems can be affected by gamma ray and other radiation effects.\n\n\n  During this short interval of a star explosion, a supernova can radiate as much energy as the Sun is expected to emit over its entire life span. The explosion expels much or all of a star\'s material at a velocity of up to 30,000 km/s (10\% of the speed of light), driving a shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium. This shock wave sweeps up an expanding shell of gas and dust called a supernova remnant.\n\n\nAll supernova are not created equal but most will have devastating effects on their local star systems. This can include emissions of gamma ray pulses and other energetic radiations including dangerous cosmic rays. In extreme conditions, the star\'s collapse could even result in a singularity or black hole.\n','Thaddeus Howze',https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/2765,http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/36539/what-planets-in-the-romulan-system-survived-the-supernova,LIFE_ARTS,scifi.stackexchange.com,0.8888888888888888,0.4444444444444444,0.0,0.3333333333333333,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,0.5555555555555556,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.8888888888888888,supernova radiate much energy sun expected emit entire life span explosion expels much star material velocity,star collapse could even result singularity black hole n,supernova radiate much energy sun expected emit entire life span explosion expels much star material velocity star collapse could even result singularity black hole n

127, and make all numpy functions return float32 instead of float64?\n',max,https://stackoverflow.com/users/336527,'The answer is quite simple:  the memory allocation might be part of it," but the biggest problem is that arithmetic operations for numpy scalars is done using \""ufuncs\"" which are meant to be fast for several hundred values not just 1.  There is some overhead in choosing the correct function to call and setting up the loops.  Overhead which is un-necessary for scalars.  \n\nIt was easier to just have the scalars be converted to 0-d arrays and then passed to the corresponding numpy ufunc then write separate calculation methods for each of the many different scalar types that NumPy supports.  \n\nThe intent was that optimized versions of the scalar math would be added to the type-objects in C.  This could still happen", but it never has happened because no-one has been motivated enough to do it.

181, a weak driver, and clock wiring that starts at the \'first\' chip (the one that receives the data). A \'standard\' solution is to feed the clock starting at the last chip.\n\nA better solution is to use a chip like the CD4094 that has a delayed output. It has an extra flipflop, that is clocked on the opposite edge. Using this output to feed the nect SR eliminates all setup/hold problems (but it does reduce the maximum clock frequency).\n\nI think you can achieve the same effect (sort of poor man\'s implementation of the delayed output) by clocking the even 595\'s with the plain clock, and the odd 595\'s with the inverted clock.

224, he would look at the bronze serpent and live.  One had to look at the bronze statue of the serpent to be healed, which shows that statues could be used ritually, not merely as religious decorations.  \n\nSo God does not forbid the ritual use of religious images. the statues, paintings and other relics are mediums to recall the person or thing depicted and it helps to recall the life and examples of saints by looking at their pictures.   \n\nAll the three Abrahamic religions one way or the other use these mediums to strengthen their faith in one almighty God without breaking any of the command given by Him. As a corollary in other major  Abrahamic  religion i.e. Islam where it is strongly opposed to use of statues and pictures of Mohammed, it is an accepted practice to pray at Tombs of the saints (Pirs). Other acts like the use of pictures of religious shrines like Mecca and Rock of Dome is not at all considered as idolatry. Use of Moon and Star as a symbol of Islam and as also no:786 is very common in Islam. Even the veneration of printed verses from Koran is a common feature in Islamic faith. Many would also categorise the black stone in kaaba as the idol worship very much akin to Shiv lingam of Hinduism but it not taken as idol at all.  \n\nIt is when people begin to adore a statue or any of these mediums as god that the Lord becomes angry. Thus when people did start to worship the bronze serpent as a snake-god(whom they named “Nehushtan”), the righteous King Hezekiah had it destroyed (2Kings 18:4)   \n','Seek forgiveness',https://christianity.stackexchange.com/users/2018,http://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/14615/idolatry-in-churches-allowed,CULTURE,christianity.stackexchange.com,0.8888888888888888,0.5555555555555556,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,0.5555555555555556,0.4444444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.5555555555555556,1.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.8888888888888888,merely religious decorations n nso god forbid ritual use religious images statues,righteous king hezekiah destroyed kings n,merely religious decorations n nso god forbid ritual use religious images statues righteous king hezekiah destroyed kings n

265, 6, and 9 o\'clock positions there remained marks (I guess from the four screw hold openings of the old socket).  One of these had been drilled but it was too big for my new screw.  So I drilled a smaller hole in another position.\n\nSecure the socket with the new screw.\n\nThere is only one place for this new screw so it will make for a lopsided attachment.  That is the socket wanted to lean towards the side where it was attached by the screw.  To solve this I added three tiny washers to the top side of the screw.  This way the socket was not leveraged to that end when tightened.  Plus if I wanted to position it back a little the other way I could.\n\nAnyway.  it works. \n','Jim Prideaux',https://diy.stackexchange.com/users/31621,http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/9217/can-the-socket-in-my-recessed-light-be-replaced-without-replacing-the-entire-fra,LIFE_ARTS,diy.stackexchange.com,1.0,0.5555555555555556,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7777777777777778,1.0,0.8888888888888888,0.9,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.8888888888888888,,,,,jim prideaux,life arts,jim prideaux life arts

273, and so on. People have developed amazing exploits against tiny deficiencies in how those parts all fit together. So even though the ciper itself is secure," that does not mean that the system as a whole is secure.\n\nHere\'s a simple analogue. SCUBA tanks have a threaded hole where the valve screws in. Some of those holes use a \""3/4 NPS\"" thread"," others use an \""M25\"" thread. An M25 valve will screw \""perfectly\"" into a 3/4 NPS hole - but those two threads aren\'t quite the same. Result: the valve can explode from the tank when it is pressurized. Each component is fine on its own; they seem to fit together correctly; an amateur won\'t see any problem; but the resultant system can fail catastrophically.\n\nCrypto\'s the same!\n\nTC\n'",user7576,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/7576,http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/9276/aes-256-encryption-is-it-really-easy-to-decrypt-if-you-have-the-key,TECHNOLOGY,crypto.stackexchange.com,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.5,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,,others use thread valve screw perfectly nps hole two threads quite result valve explode tank pressurized component fine seem fit together correctly amateur see problem resultant system fail catastrophically n ncrypto n ntc n,http crypto stackexchange com questions aes encryption really easy decrypt key,others use thread valve screw perfectly nps hole two threads quite result valve explode tank pressurized component fine seem fit together correctly amateur see problem resultant system fail catastrophically n ncrypto n ntc n http crypto stackexchange com questions aes encryption really easy decrypt key

306, at least do it right. You cannot detect a 9 by noting that the first and last of four bits bit are 1. If you want a signal which fires when there is a 9," you must evaluate all four bits earnestly and trigger that signal only when they are 1001.\n\nThere is no reason not to design this in such a way that a single clock is distributed to all the chips. Then it\'s a matter of running the clock slowly enough that all inputs and outputs settle before each edge arrives.\n\nRead the data sheet. The TI one clearly says \""The carry look-ahead circuitry provides for n-bit synchronous applications without additional gating. Instrumental in accomplishing this function are two count-enable inputs and a ripple carry output. Both count enable inputs P and T must be high to count [...]\"".\n\nIt sounds like these chips are intended to be hooked up together easily. You can prevent the upper digit from counting up on the next clock edge by de-asserting its count enable inputs. Whenever the lower digit is nine", your circuitry can enable the upper digit chip to count, and also set up the lower digit to perform a synchronous reset. \n\nWhen the next clock edge arrives (to all chips), the upper digit counts up, and the other flips to zero.\n',Kaz,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/9414,http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/90996/dealing-with-digital-circuits-and-their-associated-switching-speed,SCIENCE,electronics.stackexchange.com,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,0.5555555555555556,0.4444444444444444,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.8888888888888888,1.0,0.7777777777777778,1.0,1.0,0.8666666666666666,1.0,0.3333333333333333,1.0,1.0,circuitry enable upper digit chip count,flips zero n,circuitry enable upper digit chip count flips zero n

However, there are restrictions on what the pulses can be - typically with limits on the frequency and duty cycle - maybe as little as 1\% duty.\n\nThe end result is that the higher current increases the perceived brightness of the LEDs, since more photons are being emitted when they are on, but at the cost of some flicker, which is only really noticed when the LEDs are in motion.\n\nSo you get more perceived brightness from smaller and cheaper LEDs without using more current (often less current) on average than if they were on constant.\n',Majenko,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/4245,http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/164078/why-is-pwm-used-to-control-leds-even-when-theyre-only-used-on-or-off,TECHNOLOGY,electronics.stackexchange.com,0.8888888888888888,0.6666666666666666,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.5555555555555556,0.5555555555555556,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,1.0,1.0,,since photons emitted,majenko,since photons emitted majenko

But some of it can come from the ingredients themselves when reacting.\n\nAs such, it seems unlikely that magic involved in making potions is in need of being especially energy-draining, even if it may be somewhat tricky or complicated.\n',DVK-on-Ahch-To,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/976,http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/32947/how-are-potions-made,LIFE_ARTS,scifi.stackexchange.com,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333,1.0,0.0,0.7777777777777778,0.8888888888888888,0.3333333333333333,0.0,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.8888888888888888,1.0,1.0,0.9333333333333332,0.0,0.3333333333333333,1.0,1.0,provide energy n nthis confirmed fact tend boil cauldrons potions using fire would provided energy n n n suppose added porcupine quills taking cauldron fire source n n nthis pretty much answers main question majority energy comes fire,even may somewhat tricky complicated n,provide energy n nthis confirmed fact tend boil cauldrons potions using fire would provided energy n n n suppose added porcupine quills taking cauldron fire source n n nthis pretty much answers main question majority energy comes fire even may somewhat tricky complicated n

One of those sites is a news aggregator, all others are UGC and original content.  After making changes and submitting a couple reconsideration requests, we\'re still seeing the warnings.  Our next test is the nofollow approach you suggested.  We\'ll start by reducing those 350k links by some percentage and hope for something positive from Google.\n',WWonka,https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/17689,http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/32243/using-nofollow-when-crosslinking-my-own-sites,TECHNOLOGY,webmasters.stackexchange.com,0.8888888888888888,0.3333333333333333,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.5555555555555556,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333,0.0,1.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8888888888888888,1.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7333333333333333,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6666666666666666,1.0,saw dramatic decrease keyword rankings actually dropped first pages completely couple first page received warnings google page exhibited unnatural inbound links,still seeing warnings next test nofollow approach suggested start reducing k links percentage hope something positive google n,saw dramatic decrease keyword rankings actually dropped first pages completely couple first page received warnings google page exhibited unnatural inbound links still seeing warnings next test nofollow approach suggested start reducing k links percentage hope something positive google n

Slow Hand (from Badassasaurus in the Toruge Campaign of Carnage DLC ), Is a Moxxie weapon, and will heal you for around 3\% of ~ANY~ damage done while it\'s equipped.  That\'s a very good suggestion from  Ben Brocka.  I would further add that the Twister shotgun is also good with Anarchy, as the fixed firing pattern helps negate the accuracy debuff.

Or to put this another way, if a session id is scoped to *.foobar.com and doesn\'t have the httpOnly flag, then every domain on *.foobar.com is permitted to compromise a session using XSS.

459, and some can consume a lot without ill effects. Variation in the composition of the gut flora between individuals," as well as a psychosomatic component may account for some of the interindividual variation in symptoms.\""\n\n\nThe clear implication is that there is a lot of variation in the tolerance of lactose amongst those lacking the lactase persistence trait. Given the contribution of the gut flora to the symptoms these could presumably vary as a result of", for example, antibiotic treatment. Also I imagine that the effects of undigested lactose could be synergistic with some other gut disturbance.\n\nAdded in response to comment from the OP:\n\nIn someone with the (common) genotype that corresponds to \'no persistence of lactase\' the possibility of showing symptoms will be present from a young age. Apparently there is a lot of variation in the severity of symptoms. If an adult suddenly exhibits symptoms then I am suggesting that this could be due to an interaction of non-persistence with some other gut disturbance - I imagine this could happen quite quickly.

463, you have fragmentation issues which means your log files had to grow to support operations.  A good way to see what your log file should be per Paul Randal is to just let it grow for a week and reindex.  That could be a good point, perhaps you can throw a bit more free space on there just in case.  Make sure your logs are not fragmented with DBCC LOGINFO(); again and if they are, it means they grew a lot.  Shrink and re-expand the log file using this method. \n','Ali Razeghi',https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/12818,http://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/101211/get-ms-sql-server-to-release-disk-space,TECHNOLOGY,dba.stackexchange.com,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,1.0,0.4444444444444444,0.3333333333333333,0.6666666666666666,0.0,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.5555555555555556,1.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.8888888888888888,,,,means grew lot shrink expand log file using method n,http dba stackexchange com questions get ms sql server release disk space,means grew lot shrink expand log file using method n http dba stackexchange com questions get ms sql server release disk space

It might be a temperature sensor with remote monitoring or some other equally innocuous device that never needs to be talked to by anybody outside of Comcast.\n\n\n  Would the fact that it\'s all Comcast mean that they have their routers setup wrong?\n\n\nSince your traceroute shows that all the packets remain within the Comcast network, it\'s actually not a very surprising circumstance that you\'ve run into.

480, speed is maximum. This is just a graph of any old motor I stole from the internet BUT it is largely representative of all DC motors.\n\nNow look at the red curve - this is mechanical power out and equates to: -\n\nMechanical power = \\$2\\pi n T\\$ where n is revs per second and T is torque in newton metres (N.m)\n\nSo," the 3.5 kg.cm translates to approximately 35 N.cm or about 0.35 N.m \n\nA \""speed\"" of 0.2 seconds per 60 degrees is upside down but", rearranging, it basically means 0.166 revs per fifth of a second and this translates to 0.833 revs per second.\n\nGo back to the graph and note that max power is roughly when both torque and speed are at their respective half values therefore,\n\nPower is \\$2 \\times\\pi \\times (0.833/2) \\times (0.35/2)\\$ = 0.458 watts\n\nThis is the peak mechanical output power I have estimated from the limited information in the data sheet. Of course it might be a bit higher or lower. \n\nNext," a motor this small may not be very efficient at converting electrical power to mechancial power so we need to apply a \""frig\"" factor. Let\'s say it\'s 50\% efficient. This now means the input electical power might be about 0.9 watts.\n\nThere is a lot of hand waving here and to play a little more safely you might assume that the power supply needs to supply maybe double this value. I suspect there will be a little H bridge controller inside the servo and this might only be 50\% efficient so maybe 2 watts should cover most eventualities.\n\nPlease insert your own numbers and frig factors into the equations if you think I may have over-egged the omelette.\n'",'Andy aka',https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/20218,http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/178416/powering-a-futaba-s3003-servo,TECHNOLOGY,electronics.stackexchange.com,0.8333333333333334,0.5,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,0.8333333333333334,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.9,0.5,0.0,1.0,1.0,rearranging,motor small may efficient converting electrical power mechancial power need apply frig factor let say efficient means input electical power might watts n nthere lot hand waving play little safely might assume power supply needs supply maybe double value suspect little h bridge controller inside servo might efficient maybe watts cover eventualities n nplease insert numbers frig factors equations think may egged omelette n,rearranging motor small may efficient converting electrical power mechancial power need apply frig factor let say efficient means input electical power might watts n nthere lot hand waving play little safely might assume power supply needs supply maybe double value suspect little h bridge controller inside servo might efficient maybe watts cover eventualities n nplease insert numbers frig factors equations think may egged omelette n

484, you either need to increase the capacitance a lot or, decrease the transfer energy by increasing the operating frequency. Modern switchers regularly operate at 500kHz and this means the energy per cycle reduces from 250\\$\\mu J\\$ to 5\\$\\mu J\\$ in this example.\n\nShould this be the case (500kHz operation), the rogue energy from the inductor would make the capacitor\'s stored energy 130\\$\\mu J\\$ and this means a peak voltage of 5.1 volts - probably quite acceptable for load dumping on a switcher.\n\nOperating at higher frequencies requires faster silicon but, the ability to control load variations (and their repercussions), on a cyclic basis, means much tighter control of the output voltage.\n\nThis is just an example to see where you might be going wrong.\n','Andy aka',https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/20218,http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/83275/buck-converter-with-op-amp-inductor-issues-when-load-changes,SCIENCE,electronics.stackexchange.com,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,1.0,0.4444444444444444,0.3333333333333333,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.5555555555555556,1.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,1.0,0.9333333333333332,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.8888888888888888,rogue energy inductor would make capacitor stored energy mu j means peak voltage volts probably quite acceptable load dumping switcher n noperating higher frequencies requires faster silicon,means much tighter control output voltage n nthis example see might going wrong n,rogue energy inductor would make capacitor stored energy mu j means peak voltage volts probably quite acceptable load dumping switcher n noperating higher frequencies requires faster silicon means much tighter control output voltage n nthis example see might going wrong n

497, you probably cannot use STL containers for this because the exercise is to write your own container, but utilities like swap may be permitted (plus you can throw std exceptions).\n\nI don\'t see why -1 shouldn\'t be a valid number in your stack. If someone does not know whether your stack is empty and tries a peek() from code, they would get -1 (plus some cout that they cannot handle). Perhaps have a method\n\nbool empty() const;\n\n\nwhich tells you if the stack is empty or not. You could also have size() and capacity() access methods.\n\nYou might want to be able to resize the capacity of your stack. If you find that difficult, have a private constructor that takes a new capacity plus a reference to an existing stack. That constructor can create the data with the relevant size and copy the data into it.\n\nYour internal method would call this constructor to create a new bigger capacity stack, then invoke the swap() method. The temporary one would now disappear. (Do not create it with new).\n\nOn a style issue:\n\n\nInitialize your members in the constructor initialization list, not the body of your constructor.\nDo not use this-&gt; all over the code.\n\n',CashCow,https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/10077,http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/23597/simple-static-integer-stack,TECHNOLOGY,codereview.stackexchange.com,0.8888888888888888,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,1.0,0.4444444444444444,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.7777777777777778,0.8888888888888888,0.6666666666666666,1.0,1.0,0.8666666666666666,0.3333333333333333,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,0.8888888888888888,would get plus cout cannot handle perhaps method n nbool empty const n n nwhich tells stack empty could also size capacity access methods n nyou might want able resize capacity stack find difficult,body constructor ndo use code n n,would get plus cout cannot handle perhaps method n nbool empty const n n nwhich tells stack empty could also size capacity access methods n nyou might want able resize capacity stack find difficult body constructor ndo use code n n

499, make it so you get consumables inside dungeons, but once you leave the dungeon the consumables go away.  That way, the item can\'t be hoarded because it isn\'t permanent. Since you don\'t have persistent consumable inventory beyond the dungeon, the user doesn\'t feel that the item has as much value. \n\nAlternatively, you could also do things like dramatically limit the number of single use items the player can carry.  The logic being that if you don\'t use the items you\'re leaving a bunch of consumables behind.  It isn\'t as good an approach as forcing the items out of the user\'s inventory, but it might also encourage the user to churn through their items.\n',Tetrad,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/51,http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/55558/how-to-prevent-the-too-awesome-to-use-syndrome,TECHNOLOGY,gamedev.stackexchange.com,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,1.0,0.9333333333333332,1.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,1.0,item hoarded permanent since persistent consumable inventory beyond dungeon,might also encourage user churn items n,item hoarded permanent since persistent consumable inventory beyond dungeon might also encourage user churn items n

539, you can choose a smaller reservoir capacitor such that the worst-case ripple valley voltage is still above the regulator drop-out voltage.  This extra ripple translates into less heat wasted in the regulator.\n\nDo note that you must NOT allow the ripple valley voltage to drop below the regulator drop-out voltage or the resulting regulated DC supply will have AC Mains ripple present in the output.  That can cause all manner of problems, especially in audio circuits.\n\nFinally, pay attention to the ripple current rating of the reservoir capacitor when choosing a suitable part.

550, so any genetic influence on their behaviour can be carried on.) This also goes far into the field of memetic evolution, which is disputed but may be interesting to read about.\n\nPolitical reasons: As in, dying for one\'s nation or country rather than because of teachings. This probably has a defensive behaviour towards one\'s own group as the genetic influence. Also, reputation plays a big role: see shigeta\'s excellent answer.\n\nYou also mention willingness to subordinate oneself which is a very common pattern not only in humans. Richard Dawkins touches on this in The Selfish Gene," but there are probably papers more focussed on this particular topic out there as well.\n\nI think it is far-fetched to assume a genetic inheritance of in general \""willingness to die for something\"" (which would be required for genetic evolution to work on it). Each thing that some people may be willing to die for can have completely different reasons. I think in these terms the willingness to die is usually an exaggeration of a behaviour which evolved for different reasons.\n'",Armatus,https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/806,http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2366/does-becoming-martyr-have-an-evolutionary-advantage,SCIENCE,biology.stackexchange.com,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,0.5,0.3333333333333333,0.5,0.6666666666666666,0.4444444444444444,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.8888888888888888,1.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,1.0,0.8666666666666666,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.8888888888888888,,dying one nation country rather teachings probably defensive behaviour towards one group genetic influence also,armatus,dying one nation country rather teachings probably defensive behaviour towards one group genetic influence also armatus

555,https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/598,'A Pseudo Random Generator (PRG) and a hash function are both Pseudo Random Functions (PRFs), but they have different security considerations.

560,https://rpg.stackexchange.com/users/4492,"'It\'s totally possible and a player did it in one of my game. The challenge with Gestalt is the \""Duration: Sustained\"" part. You get KO? Your symbiote is kicked out or something. You can buy extras to make this continuous if you like. Just remember that gestalt is meant to represent two creatures (or more) of equal power level that together creates a single more powerful being. So if you play in a 150 PP campaign", your human and your symbiote would have 75 PP each etc. It\'s possible but I think there are simpler approach.\n\nWhat my player did was to think about it the other way around. Why not play an alien with mind control on contact? So he played the alien and used the Boost power to increase a mundane guy and took powers (like super-strength, super-speed, strike etc.) with flaw that requires him to be physically attached to a body to function. A mix of flaws and drawbacks and you\'re good to go.\n\nIf you want your symbiote to be able to control other bodies and use them to protect the main host," you can use mind control on other guys here\'s what I suggest: Summon.\n\nUsually people think of summon as this unnatural way to call a minion here. Magic or teleport etc. But it\'s actually a simple way to have quick help come from somewhere. Having a move called \""Call security\"" (Summon Minion with flaw: delay 5 min) is a good example of how you can use it. So I would have Summon (in fiction you simply mind controlled a bystander who suddenly helps you.

562, first variant, so take another look at the get_option() documentation. Basically you can\'t directly access an array element with the function, it just doesn\'t support it.\n\nThe second variant should be possible, but you need at least PHP 5.4 - if I\'m not totally mistaken; I don\'t know anything about dreamweaver.\n\nThe reason why you can\'t access the variable everywhere you want is the variable scope, read up on it at the PHP Manual: Variable scope.\n\nThe easiest thing I imagine is to do it the old fashion way, just make a function you can use.

581, it\'s orbit is the unit circle)\nLet Y be the object leaving A. \n\nLet the speed of B be such that every second B crosses an axis. So the period of B is 4 seconds. Therefore the position of B at any given point in time is:\n(cos(t * pi/2), sin(t * pi/2))\n\nLet the speed of Y be such that every second Y can travel s distance. So after one second, if travelling along the positive x axis," Y will be s away from A. \nTherefore A creates another \""orbit\"" to how far it can go every second based on:\n\nsqrt(x^2+y^2) = s*t\n\nNow you just need to determine what value of t is required to determine when these two things will intersect. \n\nThis is a very simple case but it will more or less work for any 2D situation you would just obviously need to change the numbers around. Since you already have a function for B you can just replace mine with yours. The other equation is the same for every case. \n\nNow if you add another dimension and introduce physics modeling more of how our world works then this becomes nontrivial and could be very difficult and I\'d just avoid it entirely. \n\nYou\'ll know to wait if it takes longer to travel at the current position than it does at the time it takes to travel at a later position plus the wait time. \n'",Tony,https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/20273,http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/38696/how-to-calculate-intersection-time-and-place-of-multiple-moving-arcs,TECHNOLOGY,gamedev.stackexchange.com,0.8888888888888888,0.4444444444444444,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.5555555555555556,0.5555555555555556,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5555555555555556,1.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333,0.7777777777777778,,,travelling along positive x axis,https gamedev stackexchange com users,travelling along positive x axis https gamedev stackexchange com users

610, because the wavefunction is spreading out into new regions of the enormous phase space. It is reasonable to think that the system will need to thermalize and destroy all the observers long before the recurrence makes the entropy decrease to the initial value.\n\nThis observer can only exist while there is an arrow of time, so there is no real paradox. You can have effective decoherence and measurements for the thermodynamic arrow-of-time stage. The same is true in classical closed system, the observer will have to dissociate and reform in order for the system to have a poincare recurrence.\n\nBut perhaps you meant this as a counterexample to the claim that irreversible decoherence can occur in pure closed-system quantum mechanics. In this case, I agree that it is obvious that the closed system cannot really decohere irreversibly, since it will eventually recohere to close to its initial state.\n','Ron Maimon',https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/4864,http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/18595/is-decoherence-even-possible-in-anti-de-sitter-space,SCIENCE,physics.stackexchange.com,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,observer dissociate reform order system poincare recurrence n nbut perhaps meant counterexample claim irreversible decoherence occur pure closed system quantum mechanics case,ron maimon,observer dissociate reform order system poincare recurrence n nbut perhaps meant counterexample claim irreversible decoherence occur pure closed system quantum mechanics case ron maimon

634, but the voltage will be an unambigious high, so digital input is OK.  For better accuracy, connect the 4K to resistor to two pins.  The output resistance of an AVR digital out is about 25 ohms: \n\n.\nThe +5V line is used for the reference of both the current source and ADC.  Variations in supply voltage will cancel.  The alternative would be to have a reference in the current source and a reference in the ADC... not necessary here.  Microcontroller ADCs are generally happy to use the supply rails as reference.\nYou must make four connections to the device under test.  Two of the connections deliver the current, and two of the connections present the voltage across the device under test to the measurement circuit.  Four-wire connection is necessary to measure low resistances ( &lt; 1 ohm )!  Otherwise you are measuring your probe resistance by accident.\nThe opamp\'s offset voltage is the most important parameter.  Use a chopper amp and don\'t worry about it.  I\'ve spec\'d OPA2333, which is a nice slow amplifier that\'s always worked well for me.\nIf your probe resistance is higher than about an ohm, you should go for the full instrumentation amplifier.  But with reasonable probes this should meet spec as-is.\n\n',markrages,https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/411,http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/39342/measuring-resistance-of-a-wire-with-an-adc,TECHNOLOGY,electronics.stackexchange.com,1.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,1.0,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.0,0.8333333333333334,1.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,1.0,0.9,0.5,0.5,0.0,1.0,connect k resistor two pins output resistance avr digital ohms n n nthe v line used reference current source adc variations supply voltage cancel alternative would reference current source reference adc necessary microcontroller adcs generally happy use supply rails reference nyou must make four connections device test two connections deliver current,go full instrumentation amplifier reasonable probes meet spec n n,connect k resistor two pins output resistance avr digital ohms n n nthe v line used reference current source adc variations supply voltage cancel alternative would reference current source reference adc necessary microcontroller adcs generally happy use supply rails reference nyou must make four connections device test two connections deliver current go full instrumentation amplifier reasonable probes meet spec n n

647, a few of which are given below.\n\n\nThe Talmud [Sotah 33] discusses praying in Aramaic instead of Hebrew and states that the angels do not understand Aramaic.  The message here is that Hebrew is preferable over Aramaic since it allows the person reciting it to have a closer connection to heaven.\nThis notion is further reinforced by the practice שנים מקרא ואחד תרגום [Berakhot 8a].  This is referring to the practice of twice reading the weekly Torah portion in Hebrew with the congregation, while reading once from the Targum.\nThere is a general concept in Rabbinic writings that Hebrew is the holy language in which the Torah was given to Moses on Mount Sinai.  Therefore, as a general rule we should be using Hebrew over any other language.\n\n','Tim Biegeleisen',https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/2889,http://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/45330/why-cant-a-sefer-torah-be-written-in-aramaic,CULTURE,judaism.stackexchange.com,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.4444444444444444,0.4444444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.8888888888888888,1.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,1.0,0.8666666666666666,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,,general rule using hebrew language n n,http judaism stackexchange com questions cant sefer torah written aramaic,general rule using hebrew language n n http judaism stackexchange com questions cant sefer torah written aramaic

716,'There are a lot of sites that have reliability statistics about vehicles. I think msn.autos list common problems and typical costs for the repair of those problems.\n\nOne big factor is the price of the parts.   Parts for vehicles that were produced in large numbers are generally cheaper.  So you should expect parts for a Nissan GTR to be more expensive then a Versa.  Also, parts for luxury vehicles are typically more expensive.  For example at GM, pricing for the same part at a Cadillac dealership is typically more expensive then a Chevy dealership. \n\nAnother factor is your mechanic.  Dealership\'s are going to be far more pricey than local shops.  However, a poor mechanic anywhere is going to waste your time and money.  Look for ASE Certification.\n\nLast, if you are buying used, then the previous owner is typically going to be a big factor as well.  Where they rough on the car?  Did they preform service at the recommended intervals?  Did they do repairs with cheap parts?  etc.\n',jzd,https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/489,http://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/1140/how-to-find-out-the-serviceability-of-a-car,SCIENCE,mechanics.stackexchange.com,0.7777777777777778,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333,0.7777777777777778,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6666666666666666,0.5555555555555556,0.6666666666666666,0.8888888888888888,0.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.8888888888888888,pricing part cadillac dealership typically expensive chevy dealership n nanother factor mechanic dealership going far pricey local shops however,previous owner typically going big factor well rough car preform service recommended intervals repairs cheap parts etc n,pricing part cadillac dealership typically expensive chevy dealership n nanother factor mechanic dealership going far pricey local shops however previous owner typically going big factor well rough car preform service recommended intervals repairs cheap parts etc n

728, with a half-life of only 12 years. This means that any tritium in the sun (or anywhere else) has been mostly produced in the past few dozen years.  On Earth tritium is produced by cosmic rays interacting with stable matter.  In the sun most of the tritium would come from neutron capture on deuterium (where I suppose the neutrons would have come from dissociated deuterium) or nucleon-exchange or proton-knockout reactions on helium-3 and helium-4.\n\nA relatively authoritative solar model I grabbed some time ago from this paper (or more properly, from here) lists the helium-3 fraction, but not the deuterium fraction or tritium fraction. If we assume they are comparable (or at least related) then you can see that it still depends on where you are in the sun:\n\n\n\nFor what it\'s worth, more than 99\% of the sun\'s energy is produced deeper in than that peak at 0.27 R_sun.\n',rob,https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/44126,http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/153470/nuclear-fusion-hydrogen-isotopes,SCIENCE,physics.stackexchange.com,0.7777777777777778,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.5555555555555556,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.8888888888888888,1.0,0.8333333333333334,1.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,,,deuterium fraction tritium fraction assume comparable least related see still depends sun n n n nfor worth,https physics stackexchange com users,deuterium fraction tritium fraction assume comparable least related see still depends sun n n n nfor worth https physics stackexchange com users

770, breast cancer is usually caused by a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. These genes assist in DNA repair. Even if this mutation happens, these cells still have the same MHC as the rest of the cells in your body because BRCA1 and BRCA2 don\'t really have much to do with MHC.

829, he may say that you have stopped at the event horizon.  But since he can go in and see you (assuming you haven\'t been crushed by the singularity yet), it is a matter of philosophy of whether the infalling observer actually fell in or if he \'froze\' at the event horizon.\n\nAnalogy: If you are accelerating in a rocket, you don\'t have to believe that time on earth slowed to a stop corresponding to your Rindler horizon. If you wish, you can conclude no such thing. However, it is indisputable that no signals from earth past a certain time will reach you as long as you continue accelerating. But you can stop accelerating and then see what you missed. Similarly, you can \'stop accelerating away from the SC horizon\' - i.e. fall into it - and then see all the history of infaller\'s you missed.\n\nYou should read the entry on the Usenet Physics FAQ:\n\nhttp://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/BlackHoles/fall_in.html\n','Mark M',https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/11176,http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/33833/event-horizons-are-untraversable-by-observers-far-from-the-collapse,SCIENCE,physics.stackexchange.com,0.6666666666666666,0.3333333333333333,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,believe time earth slowed stop corresponding rindler horizon wish,stop accelerating away sc horizon e fall see history infaller missed n nyou read entry usenet physics faq n nhttp math ucr edu home baez physics relativity blackholes fall html n,believe time earth slowed stop corresponding rindler horizon wish stop accelerating away sc horizon e fall see history infaller missed n nyou read entry usenet physics faq n nhttp math ucr edu home baez physics relativity blackholes fall html n

851, they come and go. The Japanese expression suggests that there are many powers in the world and that different ones are influential at different times.\n\nThe monotheistic view is very different: there\'s one deity. It\'s very different for the one and only deity to dish out varying results than for random encounters with different kami to result in different outcomes.\n\nThus, you might want to stick to expressions that don\'t involve God, but rather talk about fate, or luck, or use the passive. I think you\'re better off avoiding divinity altogether, as you lose a lot more translation quality by referencing the very different divinity than you gain by maintaining the reference to divinity at all.\n',bmargulies,https://english.stackexchange.com/users/7765,http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/169134/are-there-english-equivalents-to-the-japanese-saying-there-s-a-god-who-puts-yo,CULTURE,english.stackexchange.com,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,0.7777777777777778,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,1.0,0.7777777777777778,0.5555555555555556,0.8888888888888888,0.7777777777777778,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,1.0,rather talk fate,lose lot translation quality referencing different divinity gain maintaining reference divinity n,rather talk fate lose lot translation quality referencing different divinity gain maintaining reference divinity n

890, focal plane distance, and sensor size).  Premium cameras with a larger focal plane exist because there is an advantage to that which mean photographers want and can work with.  Others are not even DSLR and are considered high-end Pro.  Look at cameras by Hasselblad, Leica," and Mamiya.  You can see both formats larger than \""full frame\"" and lens mounts that don\'t need to make room for a mirror.  They have their advantages", too.\n\nI think a new format will eventually emerge that does not exist today.  It will be larger than the 4/3rds system because of the advantages of a larger sensor regarding noise.  But it might not dominate because digital sensors have fairly well leveled the playing field as phone cameras clearly prove.

I would be more cautious of a 10 year old bike with original parts unless it had original tires and I could still see the manufacturer \'tags\' (i.e. like new) showing it had been ridden only once or twice and been a garage ornament for all but the first 2 weeks of its life.  \n\nIf the bike has been ridden regularly you will be wanting a well maintained one. This means parts replaced as they wear out or get damaged.  \n\nI have bough several second hand MTB\'s - you get a better bike for you money than new.

927, again, I think your choice of repeating checkboxes and buttons will result in complicated interactions and cluttered UI. \n\nHere\'s an alternative solution for your consideration:\n\n\n\n(1) An accordion-style menu, with disclosure triangles to reveal deeper options.\n\n(2) Hovering over elements that can interacted with reveals a text link and action. In this case a branch node has already been added (hence the green color and checkmark) so the option is to Remove.\n\n(3) This node has already been added.\n\n(4) Hovering over this leaf node reveals the option to Add.\n\nOf course there are are lots of stylistic variations to this, but it doesn\'t require multiple slide out menu trays, both leaf and branch nodes can be added/removed, and it doesn\'t require the repetition of check boxes and buttons. \n',dennislees,https://ux.stackexchange.com/users/12292,http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/64138/how-to-select-menu-items-that-also-link-to-deeper-items,TECHNOLOGY,ux.stackexchange.com,0.7777777777777778,0.4444444444444444,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.4444444444444444,0.8888888888888888,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8888888888888888,1.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,1.0,0.9333333333333332,1.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,1.0,disclosure triangles reveal deeper options n n hovering elements interacted reveals text link action case branch node already added hence green color checkmark option remove n n node already added n n hovering leaf node reveals option add n nof course lots stylistic variations,require repetition check boxes buttons n,disclosure triangles reveal deeper options n n hovering elements interacted reveals text link action case branch node already added hence green color checkmark option remove n n node already added n n hovering leaf node reveals option add n nof course lots stylistic variations require repetition check boxes buttons n
