# ðŸ”Œ Household Power Consumption â€“ ML Classification Project

This project aims to predict **high vs low household electricity usage** using supervised machine learning algorithms such as **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree Classifier**. The dataset used includes over **2 million records** of minute-level power consumption, voltage, and sub-metering data from a real household in France.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle
- **Original Format**: Time-stamped `.csv` with electrical measurements
- **Records**: ~2,000,000+
- **Features**:
  - `Global_active_power`, `Global_reactive_power`
  - `Voltage`, `Global_intensity`
  - `Sub_metering_1`, `_2`, `_3`
  - `Date` and `Time` (combined into `Datetime`)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Create a binary classification model to **detect high power usage events**, enabling:
- Smart grid responses
- Energy-efficient systems
- Forecasting extreme usage patterns

We define **high usage** as:
```python
Target = 1 if Global_active_power > 4.0 kW else 0
ðŸ”„ Workflow
1. ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning
Converted all object columns to float64

Parsed Date + Time into a unified Datetime column

Handled missing values using median imputation

2. ðŸ“ˆ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution of global power

Boxplots for voltage and current by class

Correlation heatmap for feature understanding

Target class imbalance review

3. ðŸ§  Model Training & Evaluation
Logistic Regression
ROC AUC: 0.99995

Precision, Recall, F1 for class 1 (high usage): 0.99

Decision Tree (max depth = 5)
ROC AUC: 1.00

Complete separation of classes

Interpretable feature splits

4. ðŸ“Š Visualizations
Confusion Matrix Heatmaps

ROC Curves

Feature Importance (for tree-based models)

ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings
Logistic Regression performs incredibly well with clear, clean features

Class imbalance needs careful consideration (F1 & ROC > Accuracy)

Visualization is critical for model explainability

Feature engineering with domain knowledge (threshold selection) matters more than complex models
