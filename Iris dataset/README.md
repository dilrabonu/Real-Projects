# 🌸 Iris Dataset – Machine Learning From Scratch (No Libraries!)

Welcome to one of the most hands-on, low-level ML projects ever — built entirely in **pure Python** without the use of high-level ML or data processing libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, or `scikit-learn`.

> 🎯 Goal: Learn and implement the **end-to-end machine learning pipeline from scratch** using the classic Iris flower dataset.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project is a full-stack ML implementation of the Iris dataset, including:

- ✅ Manual data cleaning
- ✅ Encoding categorical values
- ✅ Removing duplicates & missing values
- ✅ Creating histograms and bar charts (scratch and matplotlib)
- ✅ Binary classification using **Logistic Regression from scratch**
- ✅ Multi-class classification using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) from scratch**
- ✅ Accuracy computation
- ✅ Visualization of model decision boundaries

## 🧠 What Makes This Special?

Unlike most beginner projects, this does **not** use high-level ML libraries for core logic.

| Task                  | Scratch-Based? ✅ | Libraries Used |
|-----------------------|------------------|----------------|
| CSV reading           | ✅                | `csv.reader()` |
| Data cleanup          | ✅                | Built-in tools |
| Model building        | ✅                | Pure Python    |
| Visualization         | ✅                | `matplotlib` only |

## 📊 Visuals

### Logistic Regression Boundary (Binary Classification)
- Feature space: Sepal Length vs Sepal Width
- Decision boundary separates **Setosa** from others

### KNN Actual Classes
- Feature space: Petal Length vs Petal Width
- Visualizes how KNN clusters and classifies species

## 📦 Dataset

The dataset used is the famous [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) containing 150 labeled flower samples.

| Feature        | Description        |
|----------------|--------------------|
| sepal_length   | in cm              |
| sepal_width    | in cm              |
| petal_length   | in cm              |
| petal_width    | in cm              |
| species        | setosa, versicolor, virginica |
