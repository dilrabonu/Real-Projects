# 🌸 Iris Dataset – Machine Learning From Scratch (No Libraries!)

Welcome to one of the most hands-on, low-level ML projects ever — built entirely in **pure Python** without the use of high-level ML or data processing libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, or `scikit-learn`.

> 🎯 Goal: Learn and implement the **end-to-end machine learning pipeline from scratch** using the classic Iris flower dataset.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project is a full-stack ML implementation of the Iris dataset, including:

- ✅ Manual data cleaning
- ✅ Encoding categorical values
- ✅ Removing duplicates & missing values
- ✅ Creating histograms and bar charts (scratch and matplotlib)
- ✅ Binary classification using **Logistic Regression from scratch**
- ✅ Multi-class classification using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) from scratch**
- ✅ Accuracy computation
- ✅ Visualization of model decision boundaries
